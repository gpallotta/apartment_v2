      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        So you've signed up for the site - great!
        The first order of business is to get your roommates on the site - it
        will be difficult to do anything without them. Your roommates will
        first need to join your group - this can be accomplished in two ways:
        <ol>
          <li>Sending an email invitation</li>
          <li>Manually entering the group identifier during signup</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        For 1, see the section on <%= link_to 'sending an email invitation',
        '#sending-email-invitation' %>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For 2, your roommates will need to get the group identifier from you
        - it can be found on your
        <%= link_to 'profile', user_path(current_user) %> page. This identifier
        uniquely identifies your apartment on the site, and is what allows you
        and your roommates to be linked together. After they visit the home page
        and click the 'Sign up' button, they'll need to enter this identifier
        here on the following page:
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'join-existing-group.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the identifier must be entered exactly as displayed on the
        profile page, including capital letters and spaces.
        Once your roommates have joined, you can begin using the application.
        See the other sections for information regarding specific functionality.

    <div id="creating-chores">
      <h2>Creating chores</h2>
      <p>
        Apartmentalize provides the capability to create chores, which are then
        assigned to a user. Chores represent tasks which are to be completed
        regularly throughout an apartment - taking out the trash, cleaning the
        bathroom, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chores can be created on the <%= link_to 'chores page', chores_path %>.
        There are 3 fields required when creating a new chore - title,
        description, and the user who the chore is initially assigned to. While
        chores can be edited, the idea is that they will be mostly static
        throughout their existence. The user selected when creating the chore
        will not remain constant - read more in the
        <%= link_to 'next section', '#cycling-chores' %>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= link_to 'Back to top', '#top' %>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="cycling-chores">
      <h2>Cycling chores</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the previous section, each chore is assigned to a user.
        While the title and description are expected to remian fairly constant,
        the user assigned to is not. All chores automatically cycle between
        users every Sunday at midnight. This behavior is currently not
        configurable, though there are plans for the future to allow more
        customization.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= link_to 'Back to top', '#top' %>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="creating-claims">
      <h2>Creating claims</h2>
      <p>
        One of the features of the site is the ability to track
        amounts of money that your roommates owe you for certain things -
        referred to hereafter as claims. Claims can be created on the
        <%= link_to 'main claims page', claims_path %>. The new claim form,
        displayed by default on the claims page, looks like this:

        <%= image_tag 'claim-form.png' %>

      </p>

      <p>
         There are several pieces of information to keep in mind when
         creating a claim:

        <ol>
          <li>
            There must be others users in the group for a claim to be created
          </li>
          <li>It is possible to create the same claim for multiple users at
            once - be aware that all other users in the group are selected
            by default</li>
          <li>Other users will be notified via the activity feed when a claim
            is created for them</li>
          <li>
            The 'split evenly' button includes you in the calculation. In the
            above photo, entering a claim amoutn of 60 and opting to split
            evenly will create two claims in the amount of 20, one for each
            roommate.
          </li>
        </ol>

        See the 'help' link at the bottom of the form for a walkthrough on
        creating a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= link_to 'Back to top', '#top' %>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="viewing-claims">
      <h2>Viewing claims</h2>
      <p>
        All claims can be viewed from the
        <%= link_to 'main claims page', claims_path %>. By default, only unpaid
        claims will be shown. To view paid claims, see the section on
        <%= link_to 'sorting claims', '#sorting-claims' %>. Each claim is
        displayed in the following format:
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'viewing-claim-main-page.png' %>
      </p>
      <p>
        To view more information about a claim and to see its comments, click
        the 'View' link for an individual claim. That information is laid out
        in the following format:
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'viewing-single-claim.png' %>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that for claims you owe to someone else, there will be no
        'Mark as paid' link on the main page, and the edit and mark paid buttons
        on the view page will be disabled:
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'disabled-buttons.png' %>
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot edit or mark paid claims that you owe to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= link_to 'Back to top', '#top' %>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="viewing-balances">
      <h2>Viewing claim balances</h2>

      <p>
        Apartmentalize calculates the effective balance between you and a user.
        The effective balance is simply the sum of the money that user owes you
        minus the sum of the money that you owe that user. The balance is
        displayed in two places, on the
        <%= link_to 'home page', user_root_path %> and on the
        <%= link_to'main claims page', claims_path %>. On the main claims page,
        the balances are displayed in this format, visible in the top left
        corner:
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'balances.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        A negative balance indicates that you owe that person money; a positive
        balance indicates that the user owes money to you. In the example above,
        user2 owes you a total of $45.01. Any new claims they create will cause
        that number to become lower. The total balance is the sum of the
        balances across all users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the balance on the claims page is calculated from the claims
        that are currently being displayed. This means that if paid claims are
        included in a search, they will factor into the balance displayed with
        the results. The balances displayed on the home page only factor in
        claims that have not been paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= link_to 'Back to top', '#top' %>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="marking-claim-paid">
      <h2>Marking claims as paid</h2>

      <p>
        Claims can either be paid or unpaid. Upon creation, a claim is marked
        as unpaid. An unpaid claim represents money
        that the other user has yet to pay. When that user pays you back
        for the amount of the claim, the claim should be marked as paid to
        indicate to both of you that the debt is complete. The user who owes
        the claim will receive a notification in their activity feed that the
        claim was marked as paid
      </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The main claims page, via the 'Mark paid' link
            <p><%= image_tag 'main-page-single-claim.png' %></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            The view page for an individual claim, accessible via the 'view'
            link in the above image. Once on the view page, the link appears here:
            <p><%= image_tag 'claim-show-page.png' %></p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      </p>

      <p>
        Once a claim has been marked as paid, it cannot be changed back to
        unpaid. While this may cause some inconvenience, marking a claim as
        paid in theory represents the actual transfer of money between two
        people - if needed, the claim can simply be recreated.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div id="commenting-on-claim">
      <h2>Commenting on a claim</h2>

      <p>
        It is possible to comment on individual claims. This functionality
        encourages discussion and allows any questions to be cleared up
        inline. Comments will be shown in chronological order, with the oldest
        comments displayed at the top. The content of the comment can be
        entered in the provided text box. The only restriction on comment content
        is that it must exist - attempting to create a blank comment will fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'comment.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        When a comment is posted on a claim, the other user will be
        notified via the activity feed. Comments can also be edited or deleted,
        and can be posted after a claim has been marked as paid.

    <div id="searching-claims">
      <h2>Searching claims</h2>

      <p>
        Apartmentalize provides a robust search feature to look back through
        old claims. All searching occurs on the <%= link_to 'main claims page',
        claims_path %>. The search form, hidden by default, can be shown by
        clicking on the 'Search' button.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'search-button.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        The form looks like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'search-form.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few things to keep in mind when searching through claims:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Nothing is required to perform a search - a search with no
            parameters will simply return all claims related to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Checking one button in a section does not preclude you from
            checking the other - for example, both 'Paid' and 'Unpaid' can be
            checked. That particular search would return both paid and unpaid
            claims, effectively not filtering on that particular criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot search for claims that are not related to you - i.e.,
            claims that you either do not owe or are not owed.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Cilck the 'Help' link at the bottom of the search form for a walkthrough
        on searching claims.

      </p>

    </div>

    <div id="sorting-claims">
      <h2>Sorting claims</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to sort displayed claims by a number of criteria. Claims
        can be sorted by:

        <ul>
          <li>Paid status</li>
          <li>Name of user owed to</li>
          <li>Name of user who owes</li>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Amount</li>
          <li>Date created</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Claims are sorted by descending date created by default. To sort by
        a different criteria, click on the name of the column you wish to sort
        on. An arrow will appear next to the column to indicate sort direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'sorting-claims.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        A down arrow indicates a descending sort, while an up arrow indicates
        that the claims are sorted in ascending order. To toggle the sort order,
        click on the link again. Note that search results will be persisted
        if the sort order is changed.

    <div id="editing-claims">
      <h2>Editing claims</h2>

      <p>
        If an error is made when creating a claim (or you wish to update
        any properties), the claim can be edited via the 'Edit' button on the
        view page for a single claim. Note that the same restrictions apply -
        a title and valid amount are required.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= image_tag 'edit-claim.png' %>
      </p>

      <p>
        The claim can also be deleted from the edit page. This action is
        permanent and will remove all traces of the claim from the site.
        Any activity feed items related to the deleted claim will be updated
        to reflect the deletion.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a claim has been marked as paid, the edit link will be disabled
        and the claim cannot be edited. This is to ensure that the claim
        reflects the state at the time it was paid.

            <h5>Weekly</h5>
            <p>
              Weekly email summaries are sent out every Sunday. They contain

      they accept the invitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice after the invitation is sent that the new account is visible
