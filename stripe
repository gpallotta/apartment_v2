user enters credit card info
you use that to get a token
a charge can then be created using that token and your secret api key
you are paid, the person who entered the form pays
a token can only be used once

a customer can also be created
you can optionally attach a token to the customer
to look up an existing customer, you need to provide the id, which is returned at creation
you could then create a charge using the customer's token and a secret api key

connect:
user authenticates using oauth, lets app connect to stripe
i get back a code
using that code, post to a stripe url
get back an access token
somehow store that access token with the particular user
when i want that user to get paid, use the access token as the private key
  use whatever form just got submitted to get the card token




On profile page, can have a link to authenticate with stripe
if they click this, get back code, post to their special url, and get back access token
store access token someplace - user model? it needs to be secure
    far as i can tell, can't store in customer object

first time payment is sent, user enters credit card info
create a customer object with that card (if they say save info for later)
store the customer object ID in database

to make payment:
get token (from form or current_user.customer field)
get access token from user being paid (if they have it)
charge it

have a button to remove stripe info from account
when they click that, clear the field wherever it's stored
