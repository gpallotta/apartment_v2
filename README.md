Apartmentalize
==============

Apartmentalize is an expense and chore tracking system designed for use among roommates. It is hosted on Heroku and available at (http://www.apartmentalize.info). The site was born out of a desire to replace the system I was using to track this info - spreadsheets. Numerous improvements are provided, including:

General
-------
- Receive weekly and/or daily email summaries containing information about recent claims and your current chores
- Send email invitations for the site to your roommates, allowing you to easily link up and begin using
- Store contact information about important people relevant to apartment life, including landlords and porperty managers

Chores
------
- Create chores and assign them to someone
- Automatically rotate assignment on Sunday

Claims
------
- Create entries to keep track of what others owe you
- See items that you owe to others
- Track outstanding balances, both between individuals and overall
- Mark claims as paid, allowing you to keep track of what was paid (and when)
- Search through historical data by various criteria (title, amount, date paid, etc.)
- Comment on individual claims to clear up any questions
- Receive an electric bill for $47.34? Automatically split up the amount evenly between you and your roommates
