Apartmentalize
==============

Apartmentalize is an expense and chore tracking system designed for use among roommates. It is hosted on Heroku and available at (http://www.apartmentalize.info). The site was born out of a desire to replace the inefficient system I was using to track this info - spreadsheets. Numerous features are provided, including:

General
-------
- Receive weekly and/or daily email summaries containing information about recent claims and your current chores
- Send an email invitation to your roommates, allowing you to easily link up on the site

Chores
------
- Create chores and assign them to someone
- Automatically rotate assignment on Sunday


Claims
------
- Create a claim for something you are owed
- See claims that you owe to others
- Track outstanding balances, both between individuals and overall
- Search through historical data by various criteria (amount, date paid, etc.)
- Comment on claims to encourage discussion
